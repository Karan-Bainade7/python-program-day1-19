# What is the recursion in Python?
# Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself. Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.
# Recursion in python
# Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.

# Python Recursive Function
# In Python, we know that a function can call other functions. It is even possible for the function to call itself. These types of construct are termed as recursive functions.

# Example:
def factorial(num): 
    if (num == 1 or num == 0):
        return 1
    else:
        return (num * factorial(num - 1)) 
  
# Driver Code 
num = 7; 
print("Number: ",num)
print("Factorial: ",factorial(num))
# Output:
# number:  7
# Factorial:  5040
