# User Input
# Python allows for user input.

# That means we are able to ask the user for input.

# The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.

# Python 3.6 uses the input() method.

# Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.

# The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:



#User Input in python

a=input("my name is: ")
print("my name is ",a);


username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username);


username=input("my name is: ")
print("my username is: ",username);

myuser=input("karan is my firned and");
print("kararan is my frd and"+myuser);
