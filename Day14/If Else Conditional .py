# If Else Conditional
# Python Conditions and If statements
# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
# These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

# An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
